# Amazon Leadership Principles

## 1. Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### Customer Obsession Examples:

```text
When you're working with a large number of customer, it's tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you do about prioritizing your customers' needs?
```

```text
Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client's expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
```

```text
Who was your most difficult customer?
```

```text
Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.
```

```text
Can you tell me about a time you obsessed over giving very high quality service to a customer?
```
#
## 2. Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job".

### Ownership Examples:

```text
Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult short term decision to make long term gains.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you took on a task that went beyond your normal responsibilities.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you took it upon yourself to work on a challenging initiative.
```
#
## 3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

### Invent and Simplify Examples:

```text
Tell me about a time when you failed to simplify a process and what you would have done differently.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you innovated on something and it went wrong.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you changed a process at work through either an innovative new way or simplification.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you invented something.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.
```
#
## 4. Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### Are Right, A Lot Examples:

```text
Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you were wrong.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you had to use your judgement ot solve a problem.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you incorporated a diverse set of perspectives into solving a problem.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you had your beliefs challenged and how you responded.
```

## 5. Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

### Learn and Be Curious Examples:

```text
Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions.
```

```text
Tell me about an experience you went through that changed you way of thinking.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you curiosity helped you make a smarter decision.
```

```text
Tell me about the most important lesson you learned in the past year.
```
#

## 6. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

### Examples:

```text
Tell me about a time when you made a wrong hire. When did you figure it out and what did you do?
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.
```

```text
Tell me about the best hire your ever made.
```

#

## 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards -- many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### Examples:

```text
Tell me about a time when a team member didn't meet your expectations on a project.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your own expectations on a project.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you raised the bar.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you motivated a team to go above and beyond.
```

```text
Tell me about a time when you were dissatisfied with the quality of something at work and went out of your way to improve it.
```
#

## 8. Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfulling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 9. Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 10. Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. 

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 11. Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body oder smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 12. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them. 

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 14. Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

### Examples:

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```

```text

```
#

## 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better everyday. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.

# Response Styles

### STAR Method

##### The STAR method is a structured manner or responding to a behavioral-based interview question by discussing the specific situation, task, action, and result of the situation you are describing. 

##### Make sure that you follow all parts of the STAR method. Be as specific as possible at all times, without rambling or including too much information. Oftentimes students have to be prompted to include their results, so try to include that without being asked. Also, eliminate any examples that do not pain you in a positive light. However, keep in mind that some examples that hae a negative result (such as "lost the game") can highlight your strength in the face of adversity.

##### Situation:
######  Describe the situation that you were in of the task that you needed to accomplish. You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.

##### Task:
###### What goal were you working towards?

##### Action:
###### Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don't describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word "I," not "we" when describing actions.

##### Result:
###### Describe the outcome of your actions and don't be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.
#
### Sample STAR Responses:

##### Situation Response (S):
###### Advertising revenue was falling off for my college newspaper, The Review, and large numbers of long-term advertisers were not renewing contracts.

##### Task Response (T):
###### My goal was to generate new ideas, materials and incentives that would result in at least a 15% increase in advertisers from the year before.

##### Action Response (A):
###### I designed a new promotional packet to go with the rate sheet and compared the benefits of The Review circulation with other ad media in the area. I also set-up a special training session for the account executives with a School of Business Administration professor who discussed competitive selling strategies.

##### Result Response (R):
###### We signed contracts with 15 former advertisers for daily ads and five for special supplements. We increased our new advertisers by 20 percent over the same period last year.
#
### How to Prepare for a Behavior Interview

- ###### Recall recent situations that show favorable behaviors or actions, especially involving course work, work experience, leadership, teamwork, initiative, planning, and customer service.

- ###### Prepare short descriptions of each situation; be ready to give details if asked.

- ###### Be sure each story has a beginning, middle, and an end, i.e., be ready to describe the situation, including the task at hand, your action, and the outcome or result.

- ###### Be sure the outcome or result reflects positively on you (even if the result itself was not favorable).

- ###### Be honest. Don't embellish or omit any part of the story. The interviewer will find out if your story is built on a weak foundation.

- ###### Be specific. Don't generalize about several events; give a detailed accounting of one event.

- ###### Vary your examples; don’t take them all from just one area of your life.
